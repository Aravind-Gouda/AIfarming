# ğŸŒ± AI Smart Farming Dashboard

An AI-powered dashboard to **revolutionize farming** by:
- ğŸ’§ Optimizing **water & fertilizer** usage  
- ğŸ“… Predicting **harvest time**  
- ğŸª² Detecting **crop diseases** from leaf images  

This is a **prototype version** â€” mock AI logic is used now, but the project is designed to integrate **real machine learning models** in the next phase.
